# tool_tips_in_text
Very simple repo showing how to add alt text pop ups to text in quarto.

Uses the tippy library to show how to make hover over pop ups in text.  Could be useful to adding alt text to expand on terms or provide references.  

Is super simple and does not require mucking about in CSS or HTML.
